The goal of this project is to explore the implementation of search algorithms in the context of a Pacman game. The algorithms navigate Pacman from a start state to a goal state in various mazes while considering factors like path length and computational efficiency.

Implemented Algorithms
Depth First Search (DFS):
Explores the deepest nodes in the search tree first.
Implemented using a stack data structure.
Breadth First Search (BFS):
Explores the shallowest nodes in the search tree first.
Uses a queue to maintain the frontier.
Uniform Cost Search (UCS):
Expands the node with the lowest cumulative cost.
Uses a priority queue for optimal pathfinding.
